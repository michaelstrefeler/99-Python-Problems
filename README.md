# 99-Python-problems

## About this repo

This repo contains my solutions to [99 OCaml problems](https://ocaml.org/learn/tutorials/99problems.html), but I solved them in Python 3.x instead of OCaml

I decided to solve them in Python because I'm very new to OCaml (and I probably won't ever use it)

I came up with this idea after doing a [coding dojo](http://codingdojo.org/WhatIsCodingDojo/) that introduced me to OCaml. We used this website to learn the basics of OCaml.
